# WUPWTW

## Note: This project started from a bet over Spring Break 2023.

WUPWTW (Who Up Playing With They Worm) is a project bot that sends an image at a scheduled time. It acts as a homage to a funny 2022-2023 tradition.
At the current moment, the bot exists in Discord format, but there are plans to add in Twilio and Twitter functionality. 
Bot secrets and API keys are hidden (for obvious reasons).

# Discord
To add in the bot to a server and try it out, click this link: https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1089308996780957816&permissions=8&scope=bot
Or, if you don't feel like inviting it to your server, join my testing server here: https://discord.gg/w3CtfWsWx (let me know when the link breaks, we got 30 days from 8/8/23)

It won't work at the moment since it's not perpetually running. Just let me know if you want it to run. Or maybe by the time you see this, there's already a server running it.

# Twitter
Follow the bot at https://twitter.com/wupwtw 
To allow it to run indefinitely, the code was uploaded to PythonAnywhere. This will probably be the method of 24/7 for the Discord bot (and Twilio/Slack bot if that gets made).
